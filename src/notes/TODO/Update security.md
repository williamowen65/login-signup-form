williamowen65: How do I make webpack environment variables available to src files? 

GitHub Copilot: To make webpack environment variables available to your source files, you can use the `DefinePlugin` provided by webpack. This plugin allows you to create global constants which can be configured at compile time.

Here's how you can modify your 

webpack.config.js

 to include environment variables:

1. Import the `DefinePlugin` from webpack.
2. Add the `DefinePlugin` to the `plugins` array in your webpack configuration.
3. Define your environment variables using `JSON.stringify` to ensure they are properly formatted.

Here's the updated 

webpack.config.js

:

```javascript
const webpack = require('webpack');

module.exports = () => {
    const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';

    const config = {
        // other configurations...
        module: {
            rules: [
                {
                    test: /\.s[ac]ss$/i,
                    use: [stylesHandler, 'css-loader', 'sass-loader'],
                },
                {
                    test: /\.(eot|svg|ttf|woff|woff2|png|jpg|gif)$/i,
                    type: 'asset',
                },
                // Add your rules for custom modules here
                // Learn more about loaders from https://webpack.js.org/loaders/
            ],
        },
        resolve: {
            extensions: ['.tsx', '.ts', '.jsx', '.js', '...'],
        },
        plugins: [
            new webpack.DefinePlugin({
                'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV),
                'process.env.API_URL': JSON.stringify(process.env.API_URL),
                // Add more environment variables as needed
            }),
        ],
    };

    if (isProduction) {
        config.mode = 'production';
    } else {
        config.mode = 'development';
    }

    return config;
};
```

In this example, `process.env.NODE_ENV` and `process.env.API_URL` are made available to your source files. You can access these variables in your code like this:

```javascript
console.log(process.env.NODE_ENV);
console.log(process.env.API_URL);
```

Make sure to set these environment variables in your environment before running webpack. For example, on Windows, you can set them in the command line like this:

```sh
set NODE_ENV=production
set API_URL=https://api.example.com
webpack
```

williamowen65: Would these environment variables be secure when deployed?

GitHub Copilot: No, environment variables defined using `DefinePlugin` in webpack are not secure when deployed. They are embedded directly into your bundle at compile time, making them accessible to anyone who inspects your JavaScript code in the browser. This approach is suitable for non-sensitive configuration values, such as feature flags or API endpoints that are publicly accessible.

For sensitive information like API keys, secrets, or any other confidential data, you should not include them in your client-side code. Instead, consider the following approaches:

1. **Server-Side Environment Variables**: Keep sensitive data on the server side and use server-side code to interact with these variables. The server can then communicate with the client securely.

2. **Environment Variables in Build Tools**: Use environment variables in your build tools or CI/CD pipelines to inject sensitive data into your server-side code or configuration files.

3. **Backend Proxy**: Create a backend proxy that handles requests to external services. The client communicates with your backend, which in turn communicates with the external service using the sensitive data.

Here's an example of how you might modify your 

webpack.config.js

 to include non-sensitive environment variables:

```javascript
const webpack = require('webpack');

module.exports = () => {
    const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';

    const config = {
        // other configurations...
        module: {
            rules: [
                {
                    test: /\.s[ac]ss$/i,
                    use: [stylesHandler, 'css-loader', 'sass-loader'],
                },
                {
                    test: /\.(eot|svg|ttf|woff|woff2|png|jpg|gif)$/i,
                    type: 'asset',
                },
                // Add your rules for custom modules here
                // Learn more about loaders from https://webpack.js.org/loaders/
            ],
        },
        resolve: {
            extensions: ['.tsx', '.ts', '.jsx', '.js', '...'],
        },
        plugins: [
            new webpack.DefinePlugin({
                'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV),
                'process.env.API_URL': JSON.stringify(process.env.API_URL),
                // Add more environment variables as needed
            }),
        ],
    };

    if (isProduction) {
        config.mode = 'production';
    } else {
        config.mode = 'development';
    }

    return config;
};
```

Remember to set these environment variables in your environment before running webpack. For example, on Windows, you can set them in the command line like this:

```sh
set NODE_ENV=production
set API_URL=https://api.example.com
webpack
```

For sensitive data, ensure they are handled securely on the server side.

williamowen65: So Would I set this api key on github? and then use it at build time of the deployment to gh-pages?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can set the API key as a secret in your GitHub repository and use it at build time during the deployment to GitHub Pages. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

1. **Add the Secret to GitHub**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository.
   - Click on `Settings`.
   - In the left sidebar, click on `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`.
   - Click on `New repository secret`.
   - Add a new secret with a name like `API_KEY` and the value of your API key.

2. **Modify Your GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - Ensure you have a GitHub Actions workflow file (e.g., 

deploy.yml

) to build and deploy your project.
   - Use the secret in your workflow file.

Here’s an example of how your GitHub Actions workflow file might look:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # or the branch you want to deploy from

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'  # specify the Node.js version you need

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build project
        env:
          NODE_ENV: production
          API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist  # specify your build output directory
```

3. **Access the Environment Variable in Your Webpack Configuration**:
   - Modify your 

webpack.config.js

 to use the environment variable.

Here’s the updated 

webpack.config.js

:

```javascript
const webpack = require('webpack');

module.exports = () => {
    const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';

    const config = {
        // other configurations...
        module: {
            rules: [
                {
                    test: /\.s[ac]ss$/i,
                    use: [stylesHandler, 'css-loader', 'sass-loader'],
                },
                {
                    test: /\.(eot|svg|ttf|woff|woff2|png|jpg|gif)$/i,
                    type: 'asset',
                },
                // Add your rules for custom modules here
                // Learn more about loaders from https://webpack.js.org/loaders/
            ],
        },
        resolve: {
            extensions: ['.tsx', '.ts', '.jsx', '.js', '...'],
        },
        plugins: [
            new webpack.DefinePlugin({
                'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV),
                'process.env.API_KEY': JSON.stringify(process.env.API_KEY),
                // Add more environment variables as needed
            }),
        ],
    };

    if (isProduction) {
        config.mode = 'production';
    } else {
        config.mode = 'development';
    }

    return config;
};
```

By following these steps, you ensure that your API key is securely stored in GitHub and injected into your build process without exposing it in your source code.
