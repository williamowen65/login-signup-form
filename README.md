I'd like to share another cool thing I learned! 

> Did you know you can view your "live server" via your phone? 

I've had this ability when developing mobile apps, but for websites I've always deployed the app to view it in my phone... Until now!

The steps to do this were to:

- run `ipconfig` on my computer to find out my ip address.
- on my phone, replace "localhost" with my IP address
- And bam, it should work. If not, then you have to tweak your firewall settings to allow it to work.
